                <h2>HTML : Overview of what you will learn in HTML</h2>
                <br/><br/>
                <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used for creating web pages and other web-based documents. It is the foundation of the World Wide Web and is used to create the structure and content of web pages.
                   
                    <br/><br/>
                    HTML is a simple yet powerful language that uses a series of tags to define the structure and content of a web page. These tags are placed within angle brackets (< >) and provide information about the page's content to the browser.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Some of the basic HTML tags include:
                    <br/><br/>
                    html - The root element that defines the HTML document
                    <br/><br/>
                    head - Contains information about the document such as the title and meta data
                    <br/><br/>
                    body - Contains the visible content of the web page
                    <br/><br/>
                    p - Defines a paragraph
                    <br/><br/>
                    a - Defines a hyperlink
                    <br/><br/>
                    img - Defines an image
                    <br/><br/>
                    (Enclose all tags inside "<>")
                    <br/><br/>
                    HTML is a very versatile language and can be used to create a wide range of web content, from simple text-based pages to complex multimedia-rich sites. It also provides support for many other web technologies such as CSS and JavaScript.
                    <br/><br/>
                    In conclusion, HTML is a fundamental building block of the web and is essential for creating high-quality web pages. By mastering HTML, you can create engaging and interactive web content that will engage and inform your audience.</p>

                <h2>CSS : Overview of what you will learn in CSS</h2>
                <br/><br/>
                <p>CSS, short for Cascading Style Sheets, is a powerful tool used in web development to control the look and feel of websites. It is a style language that defines the layout, fonts, colors, and other visual aspects of a web page. With CSS, developers can separate the content of a website from its presentation, making it easier to maintain and update.
                    <br/><br/>
                    CSS works by using selectors to target specific HTML elements and then applying rules to those elements. For example, a developer might use a selector to target all the heading tags on a page and then apply a rule to change their font size and color.
                    <br/><br/>
                    CSS also allows developers to create layouts that adapt to different screen sizes, making websites responsive and mobile-friendly. This is achieved through the use of media queries, which apply different styles based on the size of the screen.
                    <br/><br/>
                    In addition to basic styles, CSS also allows developers to create complex animations and transitions, adding visual interest and interactivity to websites. This is achieved through the use of keyframes, which define different states of an animation, and then applying those keyframes to elements on the page.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Overall, CSS is an essential tool for web development, allowing developers to create beautiful, responsive websites that engage users and deliver a great user experience. Whether you're just starting out in web development or you're an experienced developer, mastering CSS is a must if you want to create great websites.</p>

                <h2>Javascript: Overview of what you will learn in Javascript</h2>
                <br/><br/>
                <p>JavaScript is a powerful programming language that is widely used in web development to add interactivity and dynamic functionality to websites. It is a client-side language, meaning it runs in the user's browser rather than on a server.
                    <br/><br/>
                    JavaScript can be used to create a wide range of interactive features on a website, from simple animations and form validation to complex web applications. It can also be used to access and manipulate data from web APIs, allowing developers to create real-time updates and dynamic content.
                    <br/><br/>
                    One of the key features of JavaScript is its ability to work with HTML and CSS to create dynamic web pages. By using JavaScript, developers can add behaviors and effects to web pages that respond to user interactions, such as clicking buttons or scrolling through content.
                    <br/><br/>
                    JavaScript is also an object-oriented language, which means that it uses objects to represent and manipulate data. This makes it a versatile language that can be used to create complex applications with ease.
                    <br/><br/>
                    In recent years, JavaScript has become increasingly popular among web developers due to the rise of frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, and Vue. These tools make it easier to create complex web applications and streamline the development process.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Overall, JavaScript is an essential tool for web development, allowing developers to create dynamic, interactive websites that engage users and deliver a great user experience. Whether you're just starting out in web development or you're an experienced developer, mastering JavaScript is a must if you want to create great websites and web applications.</p>
